# What *is* Conduit?

**Conduit** is a simple, opinionated OOP microframework for developing applications in PHP. It handles database abstraction for MySQL (and it's derivatives), frontend templating with Twig, and YAML-based page routing.

Bringing together a collection of pre-configured starting packages with strong folder conventions, Conduit lets you start developing apps without having to worry about boilerplate - all the way from html sites to full applications.
